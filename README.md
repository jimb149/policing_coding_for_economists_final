# Coding For Economists Final Assignment

This project uses data from the Washington Post Data on Police Shootings V2 Dataset (link here: https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings/tree/master/v2). Please refer to the link to understand the methodology with which it was gathered, the licensing, and the variables included. I used data on fatal police shootings/killings in the US because it is a possible thesis topic.

# Structure of Files and Folders
-**fatal-police-shootings-data.csv** Original Data Set from the Washington Post (link above), which is used as the basis of all demonstrations of learning outcomes in the project. 
- **final_assignment_python** - Folder containing all of the tasks related to Demonstration of Learning Outcomes Related to Python
-   police-killings-data-section1.py - Pyhon code demonstrating learning outcomes 1 to 10. Comments are included to explain the code line by line as different tasks were completed. 
-   /cleaned_data/ - folder demonstrates learning outcomes 5-7
-   /outputs - folder demonstrating learning outcomes 9-10
- **final_assignment_stata** — Folder containing all of tasks related to Stata
-   /do_files_final_assignment/ - Demonsrates learning outcomes 4-10. Work is organized in sections. Section 1 covers transformations, Section 2 covers summary statistics and graphs, Section 3 covers filtering observations and additional data cleaning. Sections MUST be done in order 1, 2, 3 to accurate reproduce the work. 
-   /cleaned data/ - folder demonstrates learning outcomes 5-7. Data was cleaned with differing strategies, as described in Do Files Section 1 and Section 3. A separate folder within this folder /filtering_section3/ is used because the extreme filtering procudes a cleaned dataset with far fewer observations and removes observations with missing values that some researchers may still find valuable. 
-   /outputs/ - folder demonstrates 8-10, and has graphs related to key variables of interest
-   /log_files/ - automatically saved log files by running the commands
-   *.gitignore was included to remove DS_Store from the GitHub repository*

*Note: Learing Outcomes 11-15 are demonsrated by the existence of a GitHub repository, the file structure, and the organization of the repository.* 

# Reproducing Parts or all of this Project
1. Clone this repository or download the relevant files to your research.  
2. Adjust the file structure in the Stata `.do` file or the Python `.py` files to your own computer and file structure.
3. Run the `.do` files or the `.py` files that are relevant for your research. 
4. Cleaned data and output files will appear in their respective folders, as instructed to be created in the `.do` files or the `.py`.
